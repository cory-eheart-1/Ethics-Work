          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>Ethics in research involves guidelines and procedures followed throughout a research project to maintain good ethical standing.</p>
          <p></p>
        </div>

          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>Avoiding plagiarising other's work or altering data is an example of ethics in research.</p>
          <p></p>

        <h3>Hypothetical</h3>
        <p>After years of research, tests, and data analysis, a potential cure drug for a well-known, aggressive degenerative brain disease was discovered and published in a research study. Scientists around the world praised the research done, and many doctors begin administering safe doses of the clinically tested drug or pursuing studies of their own.</p>
        <p>Many years down the line, skepticism falls on the landmark research paper, and a team of lawyers and medical professionals are tasked with verifying the integrity of the paper. Through careful examination, it is concluded that charts and images through the study were fabricated, and a slew of research papers based on the initial study involve the same deceptions and tampering.</p>
        <p>Should the head author(s) of the original study be prosecuted for their actions?</p>
        <p>Can an argument be made that the research, although fabricated, lead to a spike in research that is ultimately better for the scientific community and the future for fighting the disease?</p>
