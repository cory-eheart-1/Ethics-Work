          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>Ethics in Information Security is defined as any and all activities required to secure information and systems that support it in order to facilitate ethical use<sup><a href="sources.html">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>A white hat hacker works with a company to find potential security flaws in a user database.</p>
          <p>This is an ethical practice of information security to ensure the privacy of user data and confidential information.</p>

        <h3>Hypothetical</h3>
        <p>A company has developed a tablet designed for kids to play with, featuring educational games, videos, and applications. When setting the tablet up for the first time, parents must enter their personal information, as well as their child's name, birth date, and gender. The company has made it very known that any data provided to them is incredibly safe, and virtually never accessed. Is the company's stance on data safety ethical?</p>
        <p>A few years after the tablets launch, a hacker decides to test how difficult it would be to get into the company's database of tablet users, but the hacker does not plan to use any data maliciously. To her surprise, going to the company's login page and changing a single term in the URL gave her access to the entire database without login. There was essentially no security blocking anyone from accessing private user information. Is the hacker at fault for discovering the easy access?</p>
        <p>Rather than contacting the company directly, the hacker contacts a vast quantity of news networks with her discovery. Within hours, millions of news watchers become aware of their child's personal information being vulnerable. Massive outrage washes over the customers of the company, and the company is scrambling to make things right. Is the company totally at fault for the issue? Should they have checked the security protocols more thoroughly? Should the company be prosecuted for the data breach?</p>
