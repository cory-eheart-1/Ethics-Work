        <h3>Hypothetical</h3>
        <p>A tattoo artist is paid to create and tattoo a significant and recognizable design onto the face of a famous person.</p>
        <p>Seven years later, said famous person stars in a popular movie as himself. That movie develops a sequel, and the tattoo artist sees in the trailer for that movie that a main character has a drunken episode and gets the same tattoo of the tattoo artist's original subject. The tattoo artist sues the movie company for copyright infringement. Is the tattoo artist ethically correct in his choice to sue?</p>
        <p>When the lawsuit is released to the public, it is revealed that the tattoo artist did not file copyright for his tattoo until he saw the tattoo in the movie trailer. Do you find his actions to be morally correct with this new information?</p>
