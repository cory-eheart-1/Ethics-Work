        <h3>Hypothetical</h3>
        <p>A wildlife reservation park has a strict set of guidelines when hiking trails, and one of these rules includes staying to the path to avoid environmental destruction. One day, a man goes out hiking by himself and is caught by park rangers walking off the beaten path. He is removed from the park and fined $500. Was there any reason he could have been off the trail that is ethical?</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, the man is battling to get the fine waived in court. While he did break the rules of the park, he claims to have noticed a significant amount of trash on the ground off the trail and was collecting was he saw. Some of the witnesses in the court room agree with his decision to break the rule since he was cleaning up. Should his fine be waived since he was protecting the park from trash? Did cleaning up the park outway following the park rules ethically?</p>
