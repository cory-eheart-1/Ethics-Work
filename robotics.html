          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>Ethics in robotics deals with a number of concerns.</p>
          <p>Robotics manufacturers must think about privacy and security, bias and discrimination, and human interaction in an ethical manner<sup><a href="sources.html">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>The well known but outdated ethical guidelines of robotics are as follows:</p>
          <li>A robot may not harm a human being by action or inaction.</li>
          <li>A robot must obey orders given by humans except when they conflict with the first law.</li>
          <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as it does not conflict with the first or second law.</li>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="hypothetical">
        <h3>Hypothetical</h3>
        <p>This is a hypothetical. A robot is designed to assist in manual labor jobs, specifically heavy lifting and strength-based sectors which would ease the workload off real people. However, soon after the robot was implemented, a serious malfunction of the robot led to the death of a worker. Through intense research and investigation, it was discovered that there was faulty code in the bots programming that led to the severe malfunction. Due to this discovery, the head programmer of the robot was indicted on a manslaughter charge. The charges were pushed due to negligence of the programmer. Should the head programmer be charged with manslaughter? Is it solely his fault?</p>
        <p>Soon after the manslaughter charge, the public caught wind that the programmer's negligence stemmed from poor working conditions, including minimal breaks, mandatory overtime, and a rush to meet deadlines. Should steps be taken to clear the programmer of his charges? Is it more the company's fault than his?</p>
        <p>After further investigation and questioning, it is discovered that the programmer is a prima donna (a temperamental individual with an inflated view of their own talent or importance). Many of his coworkers claim that he often refused to allow them to do their work and would take on huge chunks of the process willingly to brag about it. Are his charges warranted now? Should his coworkers have taken steps to ensure the safety of the robot?</p>
