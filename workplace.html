          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>Following the company's rules is an example of workplace ethics.</p>

        <h3>Hypothetical</h3>
        <p>Two coworkers in a company have grown to be friends due to their roles on the same project team; one male and the other female. They get along, tell jokes to each other, poke reasonable fun at each other, and just generally make their work environment enjoyable. After many months of working together, the male coworker asks the female out on a date. She politely rejects, and the conversation ends.</p>
        <p>However, over the next few weeks, the male coworker continues to ask about meeting for lunch, dinner, coffee, etc. Time and time again, the famel coworker says no, but the male coworker seems aggressively persistent. After around a month of consistent requests and denials, the female coworker approaches human resources and attempts to file a sexual harassment complaint. HR turns her complaint down, stating that "asking someone on a date is not harassment or workplace violence." Is HR in the wrong for denying her complaint?</p>
        <p>With HR pushing her away, the female worker decides to whistleblow. She reaches out to local news stations and gets a story going that her company allows workplace harassment and sexual assault. Community members become outraged, and demand for action. Was the female worker in the right to release a story to the press? Was there a more ethical way to handle the situation?</p>
        <p>Who is ethically more in the wrong: the female worker or the company?</p>
